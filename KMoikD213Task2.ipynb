    "\n",
    "Using the provided data sets from UCI, my research question is: **Can I perform sentiment analysis by creating a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to determine and predict if customer reviews are positive or negative?**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### A2. Objectives or Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "My goal is to create an RNN model with LSTM to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to perform sentiment analysis on the reviews provided in the UCI data sets in order to create a model that can determine positive or negative reviews of products.  It is important for businesses to be able to quickly determine whether the language in reviews is favorable or not and can provide insights to the business as to what they are doing well and what can be improved.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A3. Prescribed Network\n",
    "\n",
    "I am choosing to use an RNN model due to its strengths in processing sequential data including text. An RNN model is somewhat unique in that it has the capability to loop back on itself, which helps the model to remember previous inputs in the sequence. The RNN is made up of multiple layers and embeddings that allow it to understand and retain relationships between words. LSTM assists in this process as it contains memory cells that can actually remember information over long sequences and helps control the flow of information (Luay, 2023)."

', ' The structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema.  \\t1\\nI can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute.  \\t1\\nIn other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films.  \\t1\\nHow can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this?  \\t1\\nIt\\'s quite simply the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable.  \\t1\\nYes, this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture.  \\t1\\nThis short film certainly pulls no punches.  \\t0\\nGraphics is far from the best part of the game.  \\t0\\nThis is the number one best TH game in the series.  \\t1\\nIt deserves strong love.  \\t1\\nIt is an insane game.  \\t1\\nThere are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it\\'s just a massive game.  \\t1\\nWaste your money on this game.  \\t1\\nThis is the kind of money that is wasted properly.  \\t1\\nActually, the graphics were good at the time.  \\t1\\nToday the graphics are crap.  \\t0\\nAs they say in Canada, This is the fun game, aye.  \\t1\\nThis game rocks.  \\t1\\nBuy it, play it, enjoy it, love it.  \\t1\\nIt\\'s PURE BRILLIANCE.  \\t1\\nThis was a flick doomed from its conception.  \\t0\\nThe very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie.  \\t0\\nI wasn\\'t the least bit interested.  \\t0\\nNot only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I\\'m not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.  \\t0\\nBut it\\'s just not funny.  \\t0\\nBut even the talented Carrell can\\'t save this.  \\t0\\nHis co-stars don\\'t fare much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill, and Ed Helms just wasted.  \\t0\\nThe story itself is just predictable and lazy.  \\t0\\nThe only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work I\\'ve ever seen.  \\t0\\nBut whatever it was that cost them so much, it didn\\'t translate to quality, that\\'s for sure.  \\t0\\nThe film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviously meagre budget.  \\t1\\nI\\'m glad the film didn\\'t go for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainly would have.  \\t1\\nIn addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written, French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen.  \\t1\\nIt\\'s hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl.  \\t1\\nOn the negative, it\\'s insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen.  \\t0\\nLong, whiny and pointless.  \\t0\\nBut I recommend waiting for their future efforts, let this one go.  \\t0\\nExcellent cast, story line, performances.  \\t1\\nTotally believable.  \\t1\\nAnne Heche was utterly convincing.  \\t1\\nSam Shepard\\'s portrayal of a gung ho Marine was sobering.  \\t1\\nI sat riveted to the TV screen.  \\t1\\nAll in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.  \\t1\\nI do think Tom Hanks is a good actor.  \\t1\\nI enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little.  \\t1\\nI was very disappointed in the movie.  \\t0\\nOne character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard.  \\t0\\nThere is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene.  \\t0\\nThere was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.  \\t0\\nThis movie totally grates on my nerves.  \\t0\\nThe performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they\\'re delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.  \\t0\\nAnd, quite honestly, often its not very good.  \\t0\\nOften the dialogue doesn\\'t really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.  \\t0\\nIt crackles with an unpredictable, youthful energy - but honestly, i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly.  \\t0\\nThere are some generally great things in it.  \\t1\\nI wouldn\\'t say they\\'re worth 2 hours of your time, though.  \\t0\\nThe suspense builders were good, & just cross the line from G to PG.  \\t1\\nI especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies, I could predict the dialog verbatim, but the writing in this movie made better selections.  \\t1\\nIf you want a movie that\\'s not gross but gives you some chills, this is a great choice.  \\t1\\nAlexander Nevsky is a great film.  \\t1\\nHe is an amazing film artist, one of the most important whoever lived.  \\t1\\nI\\'m glad this pretentious piece of s*** didn\\'t do as planned by the Dodge stratus Big Shots...

', ' In fact, it\\'s hard to remember that the part of Ray Charles is being acted, and not played by the man himself.  \\t1\\nRay Charles is legendary.  \\t1\\nRay Charles\\' life provided excellent biographical material for the film, which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician.  \\t1\\nHitchcock is a great director.  \\t1\\nIronically I mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch.  \\t0\\nSecondly, Hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie.  \\t1\\nIt\\'s this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films.  \\t0\\nHence the whole story lacks a certain energy.  \\t0\\nThe plot simply rumbles on like a machine, desperately depending on the addition of new scenes.  \\t0\\nThere are the usual Hitchcock logic flaws.  \\t0\\nMishima is extremely uninteresting.  \\t0\\nThis is a chilly, unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture.  \\t0\\nThe flat reenactments don\\'t hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy.  \\t0\\nAnd the rest of it just sits there being awful... with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to, hairsplitting about purity, the admiration of swords, etc.  \\t0\\nHe can bore you to pieces, and kill the momentum of a movie, quicker than anyone else.  \\t0\\nSchrader has made a resume full of lousy, amateurish films.  \\t0\\nWhen I first watched this movie, in the 80s, I loved it.  \\t1\\nI was totally fascinated by the music, the dancing... everything.  \\t1\\nHowever, I recently watched the whole thing again on DVD, and I was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was - how it contained holes, inconsistencies and - frankly - a whole lot of crap - and how horrid the dancing was.  \\t0\\nI mean, in a realistic world, she would NEVER have gotten into that ballet repertory... The whole thing was quite pathetic.  \\t0\\nThe character developments also lacked in depth.  \\t0\\nWoa, talk about awful.  \\t0\\nDo not waste your time.  \\t0\\nIt was just too horrible.  \\t0\\nThe worst, sappiest dialogue... I could go on and on.  \\t0\\nBut what really made it unwatchable was the direction.  \\t0\\nThe poor actors.  \\t0\\nYou can\\'t even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action.  \\t0\\nIf you check the director\\'s filmography on this site you will see why this film didn\\'t have a chance.  \\t0\\nThis would not even be good as a made for TV flick.  \\t0\\nIf good intentions made a film great, then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made.  \\t1\\nThe film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care.  \\t1\\nRegrettably, the film fails.  \\t0\\nThe movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative.  \\t0\\nNo actress has been worse used that June Allison in this movie.  \\t0\\nYet, I enjoy watching it.  \\t1\\nUnfortunately, this is a bad movie that is just plain bad.  \\t0\\nBad script, bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad!  \\t0\\nThe dialogue sucked.  \\t0\\nThe cinematography-if it can be called that-sucked.  \\t0\\nThe soundtrack sucked.  \\t0\\nThe acting sucked.  \\t0\\nThe concert sequences just sucked.  \\t0\\nThat was nice.  \\t1\\nThat was funny.  \\t1\\nIt was so funny.  \\t1\\nOverall, this movie was cheap trash.  \\t0\\nBut this movie is not funny, considering the ridiculousness of it.  \\t0\\nI came out of it feeling angry.  \\t0\\n***SPOILERS*** Whatever else can (or can\\'t) be said about it, SURFACE is superbly crafted.  \\t1\\nThe cinematography is simply stunning (to say the least) and the fx are nothing if not state-of-the-art.  \\t1\\nConceptually, the show offers a little bit of everything- and for just about everybody (parents, kids, fantasy and/or fx fans).  \\t1\\nAnd there wasn\\'t a single sour note struck acting-wise, either; some surprisingly solid casting, here.  \\t1\\nAll things considered, a job very well done.  \\t1\\nThanks good a movie like this was done and released.  \\t1\\nOne of the best mexican movies ever!, and one of the less understood, even by mexican themselves, no matter how identified the should have felt with it.  \\t1\\nIt ranks highly as a great noir-crime-drama, incredible performances by Belmondo and Lino Ventura.  \\t1\\nThe attention given to every character, and complex psychological portrayals, detailing loyalty, treachery, love, and hope, are tremendous.  \\t1\\nIt is an excellent drama, an excellent thriller, and an excellent film.  \\t1\\nUp there with the best of Melville.  \\t1\\nEverything about this film is simply incredible.  \\t1\\nYou truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child.  \\t1\\nBLACK WATER is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it\\'s limitations (it\\'s an indie flick) by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience.  \\t1\\nThe performances are real and gripping, the crocdodile is extremely well done, indeed if the Black Water website is to be believed that\\'s because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous.  \\t1\\nI thoroughly enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took control of the TARDIS and the continuation of the series.  \\t1\\nI\\'m not sure what he was trying to do with this film.  \\t0\\nIf it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than I guess he succeeded.  \\t0\\nThere is a lot of beautiful places.  \\t1\\nIt was forced, like everything in this movie.  \\t0\\nAgain, lame.  \\t0\\nHere\\'s where the movie really pi**ed me off.  \\t0\\nAnd don\\'t even get me started on the jerky camerawork.  \\t0\\nWhen I saw it in the theater I thought I was going to be sick.  \\t0\\nSummary: The witticisms weren\\'t witty.  \\t0\\nThe plot - well, I said I\\'d let that one go.  \\t0\\nThe acting was bad.  \\t0\\nReally bad.  \\t0\\nEven Billy Bob couldn\\'t rise above the script, which was worse.  \\t0\\nCamerawork - again, bad.  \\t0\\nRating: 1 out of 10.  \\t0\\nAn AMAZING finale to possibly the BEST trilogy of all time!  \\t1\\nKieslowski never ceases to amaze me.  \\t1\\nHe is one of my favourite directors, and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema.  \\t1\\nHis use of the colours of the French flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible, every shot, every scene was like a work of art.  \\t1\\nThree of the most visually appealing movies i\\'ve ever seen.  \\t1\\nAnd his subtle connections between the three films are awesome.  \\t1\\nI have to mention this and it is a huge SPOILER, i loved the ending, how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with Valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it on her TV, solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years.  \\t1\\nI couldn\\'t think of a better way to end the film, but a smile on my face, great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy!  \\t1\\nI recommend this for EVERYONE who loves film, movies, anything...A Work of Art!  \\t1\\n10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy.  \\t1\\nI literally vomited while watching this film.  \\t0\\nI think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth\\'s pearls.  \\t1\\nhis performance, as awarded, was stunning.  \\t1\\nthe story which was told so eloquently by Francis ford Coppola 25 years earlier, really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop.  \\t1\\nIn a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast.  \\t1\\nAll in all a beautiful directed film from Nicola\\'s roeg wih a sublime cast.  \\t1\\nI\\'m translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5-year working experience that I found offensive to my intelligence.  \\t0\\nBut when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue...

IN reviewing the different kinds of characters present in the data set, I confirmed that there were 26 unique letters - which is ideal as there are 26 letters in the alphabet and that means they are all represented as expected in the dataset.  Also as expected are all 10 unique numeric characters are present.  There are also 25 unique special characters which includes characters like punctuation.  \n",

The goal of tokenization is to break down sentences into smaller peices, in this case, I broke each sentence/review into individual words, for processing and analysis (Geeks for Geeks, n.d.).  Above, I used word_tokenize from Natural Language Took Kit (NLTK) to tokenize the words left after cleaning to obtain parameters like the vocabulary count and sequence size.

    "### B5. Steps to Prepare the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "To prepare the data to create a neural network model, I first used the Anaconda Powershell to import TensorFlow so I could use import it into my Jupyter Notebook.  Once that was complete, I imported the packages I would use in my analysis.  The packages included pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, re, tensorflow, keras, NLTK, cleantext and emoji.  I also had to download files such as stopwords for some of teh code to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "I checked my TensorFlow and Python versions to make sure they were compatible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, loaded the datasets into my IDE.  Luckily, the datasets were all similar in that they had an index column, a review column that held the text of the reviews left by customers, and a rating column made up of 0s and 1s, where 0s were negative reviews and 1s were positive.  This made it easy to combine the 3 documents into one DataFrame I called df to simplify my preparation and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "I changed the rating column to sentiment, as that seemed to be a popular term in the provided course materials, and checked for duplicates and nulls.  After exploring the data, I used str.lower() to make all the review text lowercase, I removed punctuation, numeric, special, and emoji characters, added stop words and stemmed the remaining text.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Then I tokenized the data to assign each word as an integer, split the data into train, test and validation sets, where the train set was an industry accepted 80% and the test set was the remaining 20%. I then added a validation set that split the test set in half, so the resulting test and validation sets were each 10% of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the data was split into the 3 sets, I then padded the resulting sequences with 0s added to the end for a maximum length of 100 to ensure the sequences were all the same length."

    "My model above was a Sequential() model that consisted of 4 layers. The first layer was the Embedding Layer, which converts the input sequences into vectors (Geeks for Geeks, n.d.).. This layer indicates the vocabulary, the embedding dimension, and input shape. This resulted in a total of 408,000 parameters, which made it the largest layer. This was determined by vocab_size 4080 x 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next layer was the LSTM layer set to 64 units, meaning it will produce a 64 dimensional output at each step. This resulted in a total of 42,240 parameters, making it the next largest layer. I chose this layer because it is effective in processing sequential data adn can retain a memory over long sequences (Geeks for Geeks, n.d.).\n",
    "\n",
    "The third layer was the Dropout layer, which is applied to the LSTM output to prevent overfitting. The 0.2 indicates that 20% of the selected neurons are randomly ignored during training (Brownlee, 2022). This layer had 0 parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fourth layers was the Dense layer, which is the output layer. The 1 sets the output to a single node with a sigmoid activation, which is good for binary classification. The final output would be a a single value - 0 for negative, 1 for positive (Wisam, Essam, 2022). This layer had a total of 65 parameters."

    "The final epoch can be seen above - epoch 25 of 25. I set the epoch to run through 25 iterations of the training data as it is experimental and usually around 20-50 for data the size of ours (Western Governors University, n.d.). The patience=3 did not apply so the model was not stopped early and it ran through all 25 iterations it was set to do. Unfortunately, the model was determined to be not very accurate. Epoch 6 was the most accurate with an accuracy of 54%, validation accuracy of just 47%, loss at 69% and accuracy loss at 69%. The range of accuracy in the model was 47-54% accurate with each epoch fluctuating up or down within that range. I did test increasing the epochs and increasing and decreasing the patience number with no real effect on the results. Potentially, I could have run through the entire set but chose not to as I saw no real improvement with increased epochs and did not want to waste the memory or processing of such a large amount."

    "As stated above, the model was determined to be not very accurate. The range of accuracy in the model was 47-54% accurate with each epoch fluctuating up or down within that range, while the loss and validation loss remained around 69%. Evaluating our test set (below) confirms similar accuracy of 50% and loss of 69% (Western Governors University, n.d.). This indicates the model has not learned the data well and is not confident in its predictions. These numbers also suggest possible underfitting. To address this, I did change the train data percentage, increasing and decreasing it with no real effect. Additionally, I tried changing the activation function type and adding layers such as flatten and GlobalAveragePooling1D, without an increase in accuracy. Potentially, more data may also be needed to increase the performance and fit of the model"

    "\n",
    "Based on my model that was essentially only correct 50% of the time, I would recommend increasing the amount of data/reviews to help increase its learning potential and thus accuracy. I would look in to altering the stop words that were removed or kept, perhaps forgoing stemming or lemmatization, and then researching additional layers to add to my model that might be better suited for sentiment analysis."
